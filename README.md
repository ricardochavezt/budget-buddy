# README

This is a nice little personal webapp to track and manage expenses and budget (hence the name, until I come up with something better :D )

The backend is built on Ruby on Rails, the frontend is built on React (using Create React App).

I took [this guide from Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/a-rock-solid-modern-web-stack?c=7013A000000ZGTBQA4) as a starting point.
